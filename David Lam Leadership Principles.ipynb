This is a problem not just for combat leaders but for leaders and teams anywhere, in any arena, throughout the business world and the civilian sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is a leader’s duty to fight against this victory disease so that the team, despite its success, never gets complacent. The risk in any action must be carefully weighed against the potential rewards of mission success. And of course, to counter that thought, the cost of inaction must be weighed as well. As aggressive as leaders must be, leaders must be cautious that they are not “running to their deaths” simply because their instinct is to take action. The dichotomy between aggression and caution must be balanced. So be aggressive, but never reckless."

That is another dichotomy nested in accountability: there are absolutely cases when accountability should and must be used. If a subordinate is not performing to standard, despite understanding why, despite knowing the impact on the mission, and despite being given ownership, then a leader must hold the line. That method is accountability. The leader must drill down and micromanage tasks in order to get the subordinate on track. But the leader cannot stay there. The leader must eventually give subordinates leeway to perform based on their own intrinsic drive—not because they are being held accountable, and not based on the micromanagement of the leader, but because they have a better understanding of why.\n",

Only those that consistently demonstrate that they can adhere to all aspects of the Leadership Principles would be considered for leadership positions.

    "     \n",
    "    2. Leaders must possess a growth mindset. They must set the example for the team by searching and pushing for continuous improvement and learning. They must challenge the team to improvise, adapt and overcome when the team encounters a challenge and must encourage the team to have an open mind. A leader must never accept the response \"We don't need to change as this is the way we have always done it\" and instead encourage the team to say \"If it isn't broken, break it and make it better.\"\n",

    "* We discussed the qualities that an individual must possess to be promoted to a people management position. These qualities are non negotiable and individuals who do not meet this requirement should not be promoted. Leaders can work with individuals to develop these qualities, but until the individual can meet this requirement they cannot be put in charge of leading and managing people. The damange that people managers who do not meet the standard are wide reaching as their substandard example spreads across the organization. It is important to note that not anyone can be leader and when the requirements are clearly aritculated, not everyone may want to be a people leader.\n",

In some organizations, the only way an individual can earn more is to move into leadership positions. This cannot be the case, as there needs to be a non-people leader path for high performing talent to earn more. This is where a growth mindset comes in. For talent that has reached their ceiling, they should be encouraged to cross train and learn additional functions and skills to support the team. Cross training across all team members ensures business continuity and provides talented individuals an opportunity to learn and grow without the pressures that come with leadership.\n",

Only when a team member can fully step away from their current role can they be promoted to the next. This ensures that knowledge required to perform a function is fully passed to the next individual and it demonstrates that the individual who is up for promotion can train other team members. This requirement includes leaders as well. Only when the Leader can fully step away and their team still continues to function without any problems can they be promoted or moved to other positions. **A Leader's criteria for further promotion is to be able to render themselves obsolete through team training and development.**"

We can speak with candidates with transparency on what is required to be promoted and become leaders within the organization, we can talk about how our teams encourage growth and psycological safety.
