The Leadership Principles outlined below are based on my experience, and provide a north star for how all leaders should strive to behave, and the standard they should hold themselves up to.  \n",

    "David Lam's Leadership Principles consists of 3 parts. The first part speaks to the *Mindset* we want our leaders to possess. The second part outlines the *Operating Principles* that leaders need to instill within their teams in order to succeed. Finally, the last part consists of the *Leadership Requirements* that a leader needs to meet in order to be effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaders who can consistently demonstrate and embody these principles will have the tools necessary to create a high performance culture that starts with themselves, spreads to junior leaders, and eventually the entire team. This high performance culture acts as a magnet for talent, creating a virtuous cycle that attracts, develops, and retains talent. It then can be exported to other parts of the business to raise the standard for the organization as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principles laid out below are taken from the book **Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALS Lead and Win by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin.** These principles are consistent with what I learned during my experience in the Canadian Army, and are articulated very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would recommend this book to anyone who is in a leadership position or would like to take on a leadership role. On my teams, reading Extreme Ownership is mandatory for all team members, especially people leaders."

Therefore, it is extremely important to instill and foster the Leadership Mindset within those who wish to be in leadership positions.\n",

Cross-training across all team members ensures business continuity, and provides talented individuals an opportunity to learn and grow without the pressures that come with leadership.

This ensures that knowledge required to perform a function is fully passed to the next individual and it demonstrates that the individual who is up for promotion can train other team members.
