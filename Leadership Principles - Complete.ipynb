The Leadership Principles outlined here is based on this experience and provides a north star for how all Leaders should behave and the standard they should hold themselves up to.  \n",
    "\n",
    "David Lam's Leadership Principles consists of 3 parts. The first part speaks to the *Mindset* we want our leaders to possess. The second part outlines the *Operating Principles* that leaders have to instill within their teams, and finally, the last part consists of the *Leadership Requirements* that a leader needs to meet in order to be effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaders who can consistently demonstrate and embody these Leadership Principles will have the tools necessary to create a high performance culture that starts with them, and spreads to junior leaders and eventually the entire team. This high performance culture acts as a magnet for talent and creates a vituous cycle that attracts, develops and retains talent that can be exported to other parts of the organization and expands the high performance culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principles laid out below are taken from the book: **Extrememe Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALS Lead and Win by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin.** These principles were consistent with what I learned during my experience in the Canadian Army and is very well articulated in **Extreme Ownership**.\n",
